# odin-recipes
Recipe project from The Odin Project

This project is meant to focus on HTML concepts such as headers, images, and lists.

I found this to be an excellent opportunity to practice using Git. The chance to have multiple git add and git commit cycles was great practice, along with trying to create good commit messages. 

The HTML for this project was fairly straightforward, create headers, use images, and then lists for the ingredients and steps. Oh, and of course links to the recipe pages!

As always I mostly enjoyed getting to apply my CSS to the pages as the browser default styles always burn away part of my soul. Simple styling as to avoid over correcting as I tend to do, white on gray with light blue for link hovers. 

Used display: flex; for ul's; applied flex-direction: column; for the ingredients list as the horizontal look was clearly not the best.

Simple, direct, and helpful project. Getting more comfortable with Git, and understanding it more which is most important.

~ Thank you.
