		<h1>Vegan Alfredo</h1>

		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
			One of the most delectable and simple recipes to make is a classic Alfredo
			sauce. I wanted to make a version of this beloved dish for my dairy-free
			daughter and my borderline vegan son, but with ingredients they can enjoy.
			Youâ€™ll never miss the cream, butter and cheese in my vegan Alfredo. My
			secret ingredient is nutritional yeast, which has a naturally cheesy
			flavor.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul class="ingredients">
			<li>1 pound of vegan pasta, any pasta shape you prefer</li>
			<li>Kosher salt</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
			<li>1 yellow onion, sliced</li>
			<li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
			<li>1/2 cup raw cashews</li>
			<li>1 cup vegetable broth</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon white miso</li>
			<li>Chopped fresh parsley, for sprinkling (optional)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<ol class="steps">
			<li>
				Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according
				to the package directions. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/3 cup of the
				cooking water.
			</li>
			<li>
				While the pasta cooks, heat a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the
				oil and onions and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 4 minutes.
				Add the cashews and garlic and cook, stirring, until they're just
				starting to color, about 4 minutes. Add the vegetable broth and bring
				just to a boil.
			</li>
			<li>
				Transfer the mixture to a blender and add the nutritional yeast, miso
				and 1 teaspoon salt. Alternatively, keep the mixture in the saute pan;
				add the nutritional yeast, miso and 1 teaspoon salt and use an immersion
				blender. Blend until the sauce is thick, creamy and smooth.
			</li>
			<li>
				Return the drained pasta to the pot and toss with the sauce. If the
				sauce is too thick, toss with the reserved cooking water to thin the
				sauce.
			</li>
			<li>Sprinkle with chopped parsley, if desired</li>
		</ol>
