		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
			Chicken takes the place of shrimp in this dish inspired by the Olive
			Garden classic -- making it even more weeknight friendly. Serve over angel
			hair pasta and you'll be in and out if the kitchen in less than 30
			minutes. Molto bene!
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2 pounds ground turkey</li>
			<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
			<li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
			<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
			<li>1 28-ounch can crushed tomatoes</li>
			<li>1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
			<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1 pound mozzarella, grated (about 4 cups)</li>
			<li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan</li>
			<li>1 32-ounce container ricotta</li>
			<li>1/2 bunch parsely, finely chopped</li>
			<li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
			<li>12 lasagna noodles (not no-boil; about 12 ounces)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion
				and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to become
				translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the turkey and garlic and continue to
				cook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon, until the turkey is
				cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the tomato paste, stir to combine
				and cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add the crushed tomatoes to the saucepan. Add the whole peeled tomatoes,
				crushing them with you hand as you pour them in. Stir in the oregano.
				Add salt and pepper to taste, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring
				occasionally, until the sauce is slightly reduced and thickened, about
				30 minutes; remove the lid for the last 5 minutes of cooking.
			</li>
			<li>
				Meanwhile, set aside 1 cup of the mozzarella and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan
				in a small bowl. Mix together the ricotta, parsley, egg, the remaining
				mozzarella and Parmesan, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a
				large bowl.
			</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
			<li>
				Spread about 2 cups of the sauce in the bottom of a deep 9-by-13-inch
				broiler-proof baking dish (see Cook's Note). Place 3 uncooked lasagna
				noodles across the bottom of the dish lengthwise, leaving about 1/2 inch
				between each. Place a fourth noddle across the short side of the dish,
				breaking to fit as needed. Spread about 1 1/2 cups sauce on the noodles.
				Using an ice-cream scoop or a large spoon, dollop one-third of the
				cheese mixture evenly on top of the sauce. Arrange another layer of
				noodles the same as the first, pressing down gently to spread the cheese
				mixture. Repeat layering the sauce, cheese mixture and noodles two more
				times, ending with the noodles. On top of the last layer, spread the
				remaining sauce.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cover the baking dish tightly with foil and bake until the noodles are
				tender when you insert the tip of a paring knife, about 1 hour. Remove
				the foil from the baking dish and sprinkle with the reserved mozzarella
				and Parmesan. Increase the oven temperature to broil and broil the
				lasagna until the cheese is melted, golden and bubbling, 5 to 7 minutes.
				Let the lasagna sit for 30 minutes before serving.
			</li>
