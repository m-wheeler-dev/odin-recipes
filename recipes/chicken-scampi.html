		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
			Chicken takes the place of shrimp in this dish inspired by the Olive
			Garden classic -- making it even more weeknight friendly. Serve over angel
			hair pasta and you'll be in and out if the kitchen in less than 30
			minutes. Molto bene!
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				1 pound of thinly-sliced chicken cutlets, cut into 1/2-inch-thick strips
			</li>
			<li>Kosher salt</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
			<li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed</li>
			<li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
			<li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
			<li>12 ounces angel hair pasta</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon lemon zest plus the juice of 1 large lemon</li>
			<li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
			<li>1/2 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Sprinkle the
				chicken with some salt. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat until
				hot, then add the oil. Working in 2 batches, brown the chicken until
				golden but not cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Remove the
				chicken to a plate.
			</li>
			<li>
				Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in the skillet. Add the garlic and red
				pepper flakes and cook until the garlic just begins to turn golden at
				the edges, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the wine, bring to a simmer and
				cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.
			</li>
			<li>
				Meanwhile, cook the pasta until very al dente, reserving 1 cup of the
				pasta water. Add the pasta and 3/4 cup pasta water to the skillet along
				with the chicken, lemon zest and juice and the remaining 4 tablespoons
				butter. Return the skillet to medium-low heat and gently stir the pasta
				until the butter is melted, adding the remaining 1/4 pasta water if the
				pasta seems too dry. Remove the skillet from the heat, sprinkle with the
				grated cheese and parsley and toss before serving.
			</li>
		</ol>
